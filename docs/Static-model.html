<h1>Program Representation</h1>

<p>[Note Feb 1: This document is currently out of date. It needs to be updated to reflect the PNodes and labels currently implemented.]</p>
<p>During editing and execution we need a way to represent Plaay programs. This document provides some ideas on how to do this.</p>
<p>The program is represented at run time by the same abstract syntax trees during execution and during editing. There is no difference.</p>
<p> More detail on what sorts of nodes are needed and what information they need to carry is in the <a href="Abstract-Syntax-and-Static-Checking.htm">Abstract Syntax and Static Checking</a> document. More information about how the AST is used during execution is in the <a href="Run-time-model.html">Run-time-model</a> document.</p>
<p>For this document, I'll assume that ASTs are represented by nodes of type AST. For example</p>
<pre>    abstract class ASTA

    class SeqC extends ASTA
        // I'm ignoring, for now, that sequences may contain
        // variable declarations.
        var exprs : Sequence&lt;ExpA&gt;

    abstract class ExpA extends ASTA
        var children : Sequence&lt;ASTA&gt;

    class PlusC extends ExpA
        invariant children.length = 2
        invariant children[0] isA ExpA
        invariant children[1] isA ExpA
        method left return children[0] asA ExpA
        method right return children[1] asA ExpA

    class IfC extends ExpA
        invariant children.length = 3
        invariant children[0] isA ExpA
        invariant children[1] isA SeqC
        invariant children[2] isA SeqC
        method guard returns children[0] asA ExpA
        method thenPart return children[1] asA SeqA
        method elsePart return children[2] asA SeqA
        

    class LambdaC extends ExpA
        invariant children.length = 3
        invariant children[0] is a ParamlistC
        invariant children[1] is an OptTypeC
        invariant children[2] is a SeqC
        method params return children[1].children 
        method body return chidren[2]

    class ParamlistC extends ASTA
        invariant all children are VarDeclC

    class ApplyC extends ExpA
        invariant children.length &gt; 0
        method function return children[0]
        method args return chilren[1,..]
</pre>
<p> Members of the children array are never null. Holes in the program are represented by <span class="kbd">PlaceHolderExpC</span> nodes</p>
<pre>    class PlaceHolderExpC extends ExpC</pre>
<p>In the view PlaceHolderC nodes are represented by dropzones.</p>
<h3>Validity</h3>
<p>In Plaay there are some trees you can create and some trees you can't. Consider a model:</p>
<pre>    if( placeHolder, Seq() , Seq() )</pre>
<p>In the editor there will be a drop zone representing the placeholder node. If we try to drop a  &quot;type&quot; such as Num on the dropzone, there should be no change to the model. (And it would be nice to give the user feedback even before the drop, by changing the cursor to a &quot;you can't drop that here&quot; shape. But this might not be possible on all browsers.) We say that a model</p>
<pre>    if( Num(), Seq(), Seq() )</pre>
<p>is not valid (or invalid). This is very similar to the XML concept of validity. For example in XHTML, a document</p>
<pre> &lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;utf-8&quot;?&gt;
 &lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD XHTML Basic 1.1//EN&quot;     &quot;http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml-basic/xhtml-basic11.dtd&quot;&gt;
 &lt;html&gt; &lt;head&gt; &lt;title&gt; Hello &lt;/title&gt; &lt;/head&gt;
        &lt;body&gt; &lt;p&gt; Hello &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/body&gt;
 &lt;/html&gt;</pre>
<p>is considered well-formed and valid. But a document</p>
<pre> &lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;utf-8&quot;?&gt;
 &lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD XHTML Basic 1.1//EN&quot;     &quot;http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml-basic/xhtml-basic11.dtd&quot;&gt;
 &lt;html&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;body&gt; Hello&lt;/body&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</pre>
<p></p>
<p>Is not valid for a couple of reasons: html elements must have head and a body as children (in that order) and nothing else; also a body element can not appear as a child of a p element.</p>
<p>So this is what the invariants above are all about. It is important to not allow the invariants to be violated. They make sure that the AST in the computer follows the abstract grammar in <a href="Abstract-Syntax-and-Static-Checking.htm">Abstract-Syntax-and-Static-Checking</a>. And is therefore valid input to checking or execution.</p>
<p>Another way to put it is that this is Plaay's equivalent of syntax checking. The parser of a standard compiler will (generally) not build a tree if the program has syntax errors. Plaay's editor will not build a tree that has validity errors.</p>
<p>Conversely it is important that the editor allows the user to build any tree that is valid.</p>
