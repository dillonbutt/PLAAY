<h1>Runtime data representation and execution in Plaay</h1>
<h2>Data representation</h2>
<p>Values in Plaay fall into a few categories.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Strings. These include numbers, and true and false.</li>
  <li>Compound objects. These are constructed from classes, but also include activation records that can be constructed by calling a closure</li>
  <li>Closures. (Aka function values.) Closures are the values resulting from the evaluation of lambda expressions. Closures, in other words are the, runtime representation of methods and other functions.</li>
  <li>The Null value.</li>
  <li>The only value in Comm, which I'll call &quot;Done&quot;.</li>
</ul>
<p> In the future, classes closures (the run time representation of classes) and arrays might be added.</p>
<h3>Representation</h3>
<p>An obvious representation is something like this. </p>
<pre>    abstract class ValueA
    
    class StringValueC extends ValueA
        con contents : String

    class ObjectC extends ValueA
        con fields : Sequence&lt;FieldC&gt;

    class ClosureC extends ValueA
        con function : LambdaC
        con context : StackC

    class NullC extends ValueA

    class DoneC extends ValueA

    class FieldC
        con name : String
        var value : ValueA
        con isConstant : boolean

    class StackC
        con top : ObjectC
        con next : StackC or null</pre>
<p>[I'm using pseudo code, here,  using the Java convention that pointers are implicit. E.g. two <span class="kbd">ClosureC</span> objects could share the same <span class="kbd">LambdaC</span> object, since the function field contains a pointer to an object of class <span class="kbd">LambdaC</span>, not an actual <span class="kbd">LambdaC</span> object.  Contrary to Java, I'll assume that in general pointers are not null. Where null is allowed, I'll write &quot;or null&quot;. The other convention I'm using is that con marks field whose values never change after construction (final fields in Java terms) while var marks field whose values may need to change during run time.]</p>
<h3>Quick introduction to closures</h3>
<p>The first three classes should be fairly self explanatory. The fourth,</p>
<pre>

    class ClosureC extends ValueA
        con function : LambdaC
        con context : StackC
</pre>
<p>needs more explanation. The <span class="kbd">.funtion</span> field represents the code of the function (including parameters). See <a href="Static-model.html">Static-model</a> for the definition of its type, <span class="kbd">LambdaC</span>. The need for the <span class="kbd">.context</span> field in the representation of closures needs a bit of explanation. When a function is executed, we need a place to look for variables that are referred to during execution. This place is called the stack. Nonempty stacks are represented by <span class="kbd">StackC</span> objects. For example, suppose we have some Plaay code equivalent to </p>
<pre class="blue">    f := lambda( a ) { a + 1 }
    f(3)</pre>
<p>and execute it with the stack that is <em>s</em> and say the top object of <em>s</em> is <em>t</em>. I'll assume that <span class="blue">f</span> is in fact a field of <em>t</em>; that is, one of the <span class="kbd">FieldC</span> objects in <em>t</em>'s sequence has its <span class="kbd">.name</span> equal to &quot;f&quot;. I'll call that <span class="blue">FieldC</span> object <em>f</em>. [I'll use blue font for text that is meant to represent plaay code. Some day I should come back and replace the blue parts with actual plaay code.]</p>
<p>Now would be a good time to stop and draw a picture of <em>s</em>, <em>t</em>, and <em>f</em>. <img src="drawings/evaluation0.png" width="1021" height="377" alt="s t and f" /></p>
<p>The first command needs to evaluate the lambda expression. Lambda expressions evaluate to <span class="kbd">ClosureC</span> objects. Let's call the new closure object <em>c</em>. Its <span class="kbd">.function</span> field points to the abstract syntax tree representation of the lambda expression (i.e. to a model object that was produced during editing). <em>c</em>'s <span class="kbd">.context</span> field will point to <em>s</em>.</p>
<p>For the <span class="blue">f := </span><em>c</em>  assignment to happen, we need to find <span class="blue">f</span>'s representation. This is done by the following algorithm.</p>
<pre>    function lookUp( varName : String, stack :  ) : FieldC or null
        if stack == null then null
        else if stack.top has a field whose name is varName then that field
        else lookUp( varName, stack.next )</pre>
<p>Running this function with arguments &quot;f&quot; and <em>s</em> finds <em>f</em>. Ececuting <span class="blue">f := </span><em>c</em> means , the <span class="kbd">.value</span> field of the <span class="kbd">FieldC</span> object <em>f</em> is set to point to <em>c</em>.</p>
<p>It's a good time to update that picture to include <em>c</em>.<img src="drawings/evaluation1.png" width="1098" height="573" alt="adding c" /></p>
<p>[There is a small error in this diagram and the next few. Function bodies are always sequences, so the body pointer should point to a sequence with one child, which is the node labelled by &quot;+&quot;. Also there should be another node between the lambda node (that function points to) and its parameter. Finally lambda nodes have another child, which is their return type.]</p>
<p>Now consider the second line: <span class="blue">f(3)</span>. The variable <span class="blue">f</span> is evaluated by running <span class="kbd">lookUp(&quot;f&quot;, </span><em>s</em><span class="kbd">)</span>, which results again in <em>f</em> and then the <span class="kbd">.value</span> field is taken. So the value of the <span class="kbd">f</span> is a closure represented by <em>c</em>. Next the string 3 is evaluated, this results in a <span class="kbd">StringC</span> object, call it <em>3</em>. Now the closure is applied to its argument. To do this we first construct an &quot;activation record&quot;. (activation records are also known a &quot;stack frames&quot;.) The fields of the record  correspond to the parameters of the function. So we have a new <span class="kbd">ObjectC</span> object (call it <em>r</em>) with one field (all it <em>a</em>). Of course <em>a</em><span class="kbd">.name</span> is &quot;a&quot; and <em>a</em><span class="kbd">.value</span> is <em>3</em>. And we construct a new StackC object (call it <em>s</em>1). <em>s</em>1<span class="kbd">.top</span> is <em>r</em> and <em>s</em>1<span class="kbd">.next</span> is <em>s</em>.</p>
<p>Its a good time to update the picture.</p>
<p><img src="drawings/evaluation2.png" width="1090" height="640" alt="adding s1, r, and a" /></p>
<p>Now to complete the evaluation of the expression <span class="blue">f(3)</span>, we evaluate the expression <span class="blue"> a + 1 </span>using <em>s</em>1 as the stack. So now, when &quot;a&quot; is looked up, the <em>a</em> field is found and its value is <em>3</em>. After the addition, the result is a <span class="kbd">StringValueC</span> object representing a 4.</p>
<p>For this example, the recursive case of lookUp hasn't been used and so the <span class="kbd">.next</span> field of class <span class="kbd">StackC</span> has not been used. And that means that value of the <span class="kbd">.context</span> field of class <span class="kbd">FunctionC</span> hasn't yet mattered. Let's change the example a bit to</p>
<pre class="blue">    b := 5
    f := lambda( a ) { a + b }
    f(3)</pre>
<p>We'll assume that <em>t</em> has another FieldC <em>b</em>, representing <span class="blue">b</span>. This time what happens when  <span class="blue"> a + b </span>is evaluated using <em>s</em>1 as the stack? When b is looked up the call to <span class="kbd">lookUp(&quot;b&quot;, </span><em>s</em>1<span class="kbd">)</span> recurses to <span class="kbd">lookUp(&quot;b&quot;, </span><em>s</em><span class="kbd">)</span> which results in <em>b</em>. The result then represents 8. </p>
<p>The following figure shows the stack when <span class="blue">a+b</span> is evaluated.<img src="drawings/evaluation3.png" width="1105" height="632" alt="adding field b to the activation record" /></p>
<p>Now add a couple of lines so we have</p>
<pre class="blue">    b := 5
    f := lambda( a : Num ) { a + b }
    f(3)
    b := 6
    f(3)</pre>
<p>The second call results in an object representing 9.</p>
<p>The need for the context is really shown when we call a closure somewhere far away from where it is created.</p>
<p>Consider </p>
<pre class="blue">    var b : Num := null
    f := lambda( a : Num ) { b := a }
    g( f )</pre>
<p>Somewhere deep in <span class="blue">g</span>, there may be a call to the closure stored in <span class="blue">f</span>. It is important that at that time the lookUp routine finds the <span class="blue">b</span> that was declared in the code above. This should be true even if <span class="blue">g</span> declares a variable called &quot;b&quot;.</p>
<p>A closure may be called even after the subroutine in which it was called has returned. Consider the following code</p>
<pre class="blue">    con scale := lambda( a : Num ) { 
                      lambda(x : Num ) { a * x } }
    con double := scale( 2 ) 
    con triple := scale( 3 )
</pre>
<p>So that <span class="blue">double(42)</span> gives
84.</p>
<p>When <span class="blue">scale( 2 )</span> is called, the value is a closure created by the evaluation of <span class="blue">lambda(x : Num ) { a * x }</span> in a context where &quot;a&quot; is bound to 2. This context is captured retained in the closure.</p>
<p>Exercise. Draw a picture representing the stack after these three declarations are done. To do that you should know that each var or con declaration pushes another StackC object on the stack. So after these three declarations have executed, the stack should consists of at least three objects, each with one field. Also you should know that the initialization expression is evaluated using the new stack. So the context for the value of scale will point to the activation record in which &quot;scale&quot; is the name of the field. This makes it easier to write recursive functions.</p>
<p>Now suppose there is a call <span class="blue">double(3)</span>. Draw the stack in which <span class="blue">a * x</span> is evaluated.</p>
<p>Finally closures are used to allow fields of objects to be looked up by the classes methods. Consider a class</p>
<pre class="blue">    Class Counter
        var a := 0
        con incr := lambda() { a := a+1 }
        con get := lambda() { a }</pre>
<p>An <span class="kbd">ObjectC</span> <em>o</em> representing a <span class="blue">Counter</span> object has a sequence of 3 <span class="kbd">FieldC</span> objects. The closures representing the <span class="blue">incr</span> and <span class="blue">get</span> methods have <em>o</em> as the top of their context. This means that when &quot;a&quot; is looked up during execution of a method's body, the field in object <em>o</em> will be found. This is why we use the same data type to represent both activation records and objects made by classes.</p>
<h3>Undo and redo</h3>
<p>One issue I'm ignoring here is the ability to undo steps taken during evaluation. If we use the transactional memory approach, then nonconstant fields above need to be implemented by transactional variables. For example</p>
<pre>    class FieldC
        con name : String
        var value : ValueA</pre>

would be implemented by 
<p></p>
<pre>    class FieldC
        con name : String
        con value : TVar&lt;ValueA&gt;</pre>
<h2>Evaluation</h2>
<h3>Program Representation</h3>
<p>See the <a href="Static-model.html">Static-model</a> document.</p>
<h3>How not to do it.</h3>
<p>The evaluation process described above could be implemented using the interpreter pattern. We aren't going to use it, but it may be worth taking a quick look at it.</p>
<p>The interpreter pattern works by giving each node of the abstract syntax tree an <span class="kbd">eval</span> method that takes a stack as an argument. For example for AST nodes representing variables we have</p>
<pre class="kbd">    method eval( s : StackC ) : ValueA
        con v := lookUp( this.name, s )
        if v == null then throw an exception
        return v.value</pre>
<p>For a node representing addition we would have</p>
<pre><span class="kbd">    method eval( s : StackC ) : ValueA
        con x = this.left().eval(s)
        if x does not represent a number, throw an exception
        con y = this.right().eval(s)
        if y does not represent a number, throw an exception
        con z := the sum of the numbers represented by x and y
        con str := z turned into a string
        return new </span>StringC( str )</pre>
<p>For sequences we have</p>
<pre class="kbd">    method eval( s : StackC ) : ValueA
        return new ClosureC( this, s )</pre>
<p></p>
<p>For a lambda expression we would have </p>
<pre class="kbd">    method eval( s : StackC ) : ValueA
        return new ClosureC( this, s )</pre>
<p>For a node representing the application of a function to arguments, we would have  </p>
<pre><span class="kbd">    method eval( s : StackC ) : ValueA
        con c := this.function.eval( s )
        if c is not a ClosureC then throw an exception
        con as := [this.args[0].eval(s), this.args,[1].eval, ... ]

        con ps := a list of </span>parameter names obtained from c.function
        if a[0] is represents a value not of type p[0].type, throw an exception
        and so on for all the arguments

        // Make an activation record.
        con fs := [new FieldC( ps[0].name, vs[0]), new FieldC( ps[1].name, vs[1]), ... ]
		 con activationRecord := new ObjectC( fs )

        // Note that the new stack uses the context from the closure.
        con s1 := new StackC( activationRecord, c.context )
        return c.function.body.eval( s1 )
</pre>
<p>However, we want to be able to do debugger-type single-stepping. So we need an alternative to the interpreter pattern that lets us intersperse small bits of evaluation with waits for user input. There might be a way to make it work by using concurrency. But JavaScript does not support concurrency. There might be a way to make it work using the TBC library, but that would be rather tricky, I think.</p>
<p>The solution below is based very much on the way the same problem is solved in the Teaching Machine.</p>
<h3>The stack of evaluations approach</h3>
<p>The state of the execution of a program is represented by an object called the virtual machine state. It will probably have a lot of fields and methods, but I'll just start with one and add more as needed</p>
<pre class="kbd">    class VMSC
        con evalStack := Stack&lt;EvaluationC&gt;</pre>
<p>An evaluation represents the state of the evaluation of a single expression. This expression might be the body of a function, which is why we need a stack. If we execute a sequence</p>
<pre class="blue">    var c := 4
    var b := 5 + c
    f := lambda( a ) { a + b }
    var x := f(3)
    x</pre>
<p>there will be one evaluation representing the sequence and then one evaluation representing the evaluation of the body of the closure.</p>
<p>Let's start with a simpler example that only uses one example. Then we'll come back to the one above.</p>
<p>Suppose we want to evaluate an expression <span class="blue">a+b</span> in a stack <em>s</em> that has <span class="blue">a</span> and <span class="blue">b</span> as fields. We make an evaluation that has a pointer to the AST node for <span class="blue">a+b</span>, this is called the root of the evaluation. The evaluation also has to keep track of which parts of the tree have been evaluated and which have not and for those that have been evaluated, what value they evaluated to. This part of the evaluation is called its map. The map maps ASTA nodes to ValueA objects. An evaluation also has a stack of pending nodes and optionally a selected node.</p>
<pre>    class EvaluationC
        con root : ASTA
        con stack : StackC
        con map : MutableMap&lt;ASTA, ValueA&gt;
        con pending : Stack&lt;ASTA&gt;
        var ready : boolean
</pre>
<p>The evaluate <span class="blue">a+b</span> we start by making an evaluation that has the Plus node as its root. It has <em>s</em> as its stack. Its map is empty. Its pending stack contains only the root and ready is false. Ready means that the top node on the pending stack is ready to be stepped (evaluated). Here is the state of the evaluation initially</p>
<p>.<img src="drawings/plaay-eval-0.png" width="709" height="200" alt="0" /></p>
<p>In single stem mode, the user will see the the expression being evaluated turn into a value bit by bit. That is they will see the following succession of states of evaluation</p>
<pre>    a + b  (and the a node is highlighted and the a field on the stack is highlighted)

    42 + b (and the b node is highlighted and the b field on the stack is highlighted)

    42 + 23 (and the + node is highlighted)

    65   (and no node is highlighted)</pre>
<p>Here is what is happening in terms of the evaluation:</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>  * A select message is sent to the top pending node (the root).The root decides to evaluate its left child first (left-to-right selection strategy). So it pushes its left child onto the pending stack and forwards the select message to the a node. The a node selects itself by setting ready to true.
  It also highlights looks up the a field on the stack.
  The state is  </p>
<p><img src="drawings/plaay-eval-1.png" width="708" height="200" alt="1" /></p>
<p> The user sees:  a + b  (and the a node is highlighted and the a field on the stack is highlighted)</p>
<p> * Since ready is true, a step message is sent to the a node (it being the
  top of the pending stack. The step method of the a node looks up the a
  field on the stack (again) turns off the highlighting of that field
  and maps itself to the value of that field. It also pops itself off
  pending and sets ready to false. The state is</p>
<p><img src="drawings/plaay-eval-2.png" width="719" height="202" alt="2" /></p>
<p> * Since ready is false, a select message is sent to the top pending node (the root).
  This time, since its left child is mapped, it decides to evaluate its
  right child next. The rest is similar to what happened above.
  The user sees:
  42 + b (and the b node is highlighted and the b field on the stack is highlighted). The state is </p>
<p><img src="drawings/plaay-eval-3.png" width="719" height="202" alt="3" /></p>
<p> * Since ready is true a step message is sent to the b node. The step method for
  the b node is the same as that for the a node. So, the node is mapped to the
  variable's value, highlighting is turned off, the b node is popped from the pending stack,
  and ready is set to false.  The state is</p>
<p><img src="drawings/plaay-eval-4.png" width="719" height="241" alt="4" /></p>
<p> * Since ready is false, a select message is sent to the top pending node (the root).
  This time, since all its children are mapped, it is ready to be stepped, so
  it sets ready to true.
  
  And the user sees
  
  42 + 23 (and the + node is highlighted)  </p>
<p><img src="drawings/plaay-eval-5.png" width="719" height="241" alt="5" /></p>
<p> * Since ready is true, a step message is sent to the top pending node.
  This is the root. It looks at the values of its children (using the map)
  adds them and maps itself to the resulting value.
  
  And the user sees.
  
  65   (and no node is highlighted) .  The evaluation is done. The state is</p>
<p><img src="drawings/plaay-eval-6.png" width="722" height="258" alt="6" /></p>
<p>The VMSC is pushed forward by a call to its advance method. Each * in the above example represents a call to advance.</p>
<pre class="kbd">    class VMSC
        ...
        method canAdvance()
            return evalStack.notEmpty()
        method advance() 
            pre canAdvance()
            if evalStack.top().isDone() 
                con value := evalStack.top() 
                evalStack.pop()
                if evalStack.notEmpty
                    evalStack.top.setResult( value )
            else
                evalStack.top().advance( this )</pre>
<p>An evaluation is done when its root has been evaluated</p>
<pre>    class EvaluationC
        ...
        invariant: pending.isEmpty iff isDone()

        method isDone()
            return root in map.domain()</pre>

The advance method for an evaluation either does a selection or a step
<pre>    class EvaluationC
        ...
        method advance( vms : VMSC )
            pre not isDone()
            // and therefore pending is not empty()
            if ready then
                pending.top.step( vms )
            else 
                pending.top.select( vms )</pre>
 <p>The rest of the work is done in the step and select methods for the AST nodes. </p>
 <p><strong>Selection:</strong> Many nodes use the left-to-right selection strategy. The Plus node would be an example. The left-to-right strategy is this. Note that select messages are only ever sent to the top pending node. </p>
 <pre>
 method select( vms : VMSC )
    con eval := vms.evalStack.top() 
    pre eval.pending is not empty and eval.pending.top() = this
    if all this node's children are in the domain of eval.map then 
        // Select this node.

    else let i be the number of the first child not in the domain of eval.map
        eval.pending.push( children[i] )
        node.children[i].select( eval )</pre>
<p>  [This is the most common selection strategy, so this could be the default. Exceptions to the normal strategies can be overrides.]</p>
<p>For &quot;if&quot; nodes selection is like this</p>
<pre>
 method select( vms : VMSC )
    con eval := vms.evalStack.top() 
    pre eval.pending is not empty and eval.pending.top() = this
    if the guard is in the domain of eval.map then

             else

                 thenPart.select( eval )

                 elsePart.select( eval )
        else error!!
        </pre>
<p>For nodes representing variables, selection is simple</p>
<pre>
 method select( vms : VMSC )
    con eval := vms.evalStack.top() 
    pre eval.pending is not empty and eval.pending.top() = this
    
    look up the variable in the stack and highlight it.
    eval.ready := true
</pre>
<p>[Note on the <span class="kbd">pending</span> stack: Because the only nodes pushed on to pending are either the <span class="kbd">root</span> (when the stack is empty) or a child of the top of <span class="kbd">pending</span>, it follows that if the value of pending is [nd0, nd1, ..., nd<em>n</em>] (with the top on the right), then nd0 is the <span class="kbd">root</span>, nd1 is a child of nd0, nd2 is a child of nd1, and so on. So the whole stack can be represented with one pointer &quot;<span class="kbd">top</span>&quot;. &quot;<span class="kbd">top</span>&quot; is null if pending is empty. <span class="kbd">push(nd)</span> can be implemented by <span class="kbd">top := nd</span> and <span class="kbd">pop</span> by <span class="kbd">top := </span>parent of <span class="kbd">top</span> or null if <span class="kbd">top</span> is the <span class="kbd">root</span>.]</p>
<p><strong>Stepping: </strong>Stepping also depends on the node type. For plus nodes</p>
<pre>
 method step( vms : VMSC )
    con eval := vms.evalStack.top() 
    pre eval.pending is not empty and eval.pending.top() = this and eval.ready
    get the values mapped by the two children
    if both represent numbers,

<p>So why do we need a stack of evaluations. The idea is that each level of the stack represents the evaluation of one function. So let's look at how a function call can be evaluated. </p>
<p>The select method for <span class="kbd">LambdaC</span> nodes just sets ready to true. The step method for <span class="kbd">LambdaC</span> nodes just creates a new <span class="kbd">ClosureC</span> (using the stack field of the top evaluation for the context, and maps the <span class="kbd">LambdaC</span> node to the closure. So lambdas are simple.</p>
<p>For application of a function (i.e. closure) to a list of arguments, we use nodes of class <span class="kbd">ApplyC</span>. The select method for <span class="kbd">ApplyC</span> nodes uses the usual left-to-right strategy.</p>
<p>Before looking at the algorithm for step, let's look at what it needs to acheive. Suppose we are about to step the application in this sequence</p>
<pre>    f := lambda( a : Num ) { a + b }
    b := 5
    f(3)</pre>
<p>The top evaluation on the stack looks like this</p>
<p><img src="drawings/plaay-eval-7.png" width="736" height="500" alt="7" /></p>
<p>[I left out the two assignment expressions, which are the first two children of the root node, they are mapped to Done.]</p>
<p>After the application node has been stepped, a new evaluation has been pushed on to the stack and the top two evaluations on the stack look like this.</p>
<p><img src="drawings/plaay-eval-8.png" width="751" height="710" alt="8" /></p>
<p>The step method looks like this:</p>
<pre>
 method step( vms : VMSC )
    con eval := vms.evalStack.top() 
    pre eval.pending is not empty and eval.pending.top() = this and eval.ready
    pre all children of this node are mapped.
    con c := eval.get( this.function )
    if not c isA ClosureC then  error!
    con c1 := c asA ClosureC
    con f : LambdaC := c1.function
    con argList := [eval.get( this.args(0) ), eval.get( this.args(1) ),.. ]
    if the length of arglist not= the length of f.params then error!
    if any argument has a value not compatible with the corresponding parameter type
         then error!
    var params := f.params.children
    con arFields := [ new FieldC( params[0].name, argList[0] ),
                      new FieldC( params[1].name, argList[1] ),
                    .. ]
    con activationRecord := new ObjectC( arFields ) 
    con stack := new StackC( activationRecord, cl.context )

    con newEval := an EvaluationC with
           newEval.root := f.body
           newEval.stack = stack
           newEval.map = an empty map
           newEval.pending = a stack containing only f.body
           newEval.ready = false
    vms.evalStack.push( newEval )
</pre>
<p>Note that unlike every other step method, this one does not pop the pending stack.</p>
<p>So the step takes care of entering the function being called. What about function return? Here is <span class="kbd">advance</span> for <span class="kbd">VMSC</span> again.</p>
<pre class="kbd">    class VMSC
        ...
        method canAdvance()
            return evalStack.notEmpty()
        method advance() 
            pre canAdvance()
            if evalStack.top().isDone() 
                con value := evalStack.top() 
                evalStack.pop()
                if evalStack.notEmpty
                    evalStack.top.setResult( value )
            else
                evalStack.top().advance( this )</pre>
<p>Once the function has executed as far as it can, its root node (i.e. the function body) will be mapped to its return value. The next call to <span class="kbd">vms.advance</span> records this return value, pops the evaluation, and sends the return value to the next evaluation down the stack (i.e. the new top) using the <span class="kbd">setResult</span> method. So what we need to do is implement that method.</p>
<pre>    class EvaluationC
        ...
        method setResult( value : ValueA ) {
            pre: The pending stack is not empty and its top node is an ApplyC
            con node : ApplyC  := this.pending.top
            con lambda : = this.map.get(node.function) 
            if lambda has a result type and the type of value is not compatible 
                then error!
            this.map.set( node, value )
            this.pending.pop() 
            this.ready := false
</pre>
<h3>  Allowing editing during execution</h3>
<p>It would be nice if during execution one could edit the program, for example to fix mistakes or fill in missing parts. In order not to mess up any partially complete evaluations, it is important not to change some AST.  For example if we deleted a node that is on a pending stack, that would cause problems the next time we send a step or select message that node. </p>
<p>One way to accomplish this is to make a copy of the relevant part of the program tree each time an new evaluation is made. (For example in the step method of ApplyC.). Then the original can be edited to one's heart's content, although evaluations currently on the stack will not be affected by the changes. </p>
<p>pro: No restriction on editing.</p>
<p>con: Edits do not affect current evaluations and so the user may see &quot;old code&quot; when they return to execution mode.</p>
<p>precedent: This was done in the Sharp APL editor. It was also done in the 1985 implementation of Prograph.</p>
<p>Another solution is to consider &quot;locked&quot; any node such that changing it could mess up a current evaluation. I think it is sufficient to say that a node is locked iff it is in the pending stack of some evaluation on the evaluation stack. Each node is provided with a counter. The counter is incremented when the node is pushed on to the pending stack and decremented on pop. The node is locked if the counter isA locked node can not have any of children changed nor any of its other attributes changed.</p>
<p>pro: There is only one current copy of each function body.</p>
<p>con: There are restrictions on what can be edited.</p>
<p>con: Complicates the program editor.</p>
<p>con: Complicates undo/redo in the editor. Suppose I make an edit to node x. Later it becomes locked. And then I try to undo my edit. This undo must be prevented somehow.</p>
